# This properties file is automatically taken in consideration when you
# check the module "bsp" in your "*.platform" file.
#
# This file lists the properties you can modify to customize the
# module.
#
# Notes:
# - The following property declaration sets the property value with a
#   empty value:
#	my_property=
# - To use the default value of an optional property, the property must
#   not appear in the file (or must be set in comment).
# - This file respects the Java properties file convention: the OS path
#	must use the UNIX path convention (path separator is '/'). The WINDOWS
#	paths must have been converted manually replacing '\' by '/' or by '\\'.
